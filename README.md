## Planned modules
made by AI may be changed on the go

### 1. Core Modules

#### a. Storage Engine

This is the foundation of the database, responsible for managing how data is stored and retrieved from disk.

Responsibilities:
File management (read, write, append).
Data serialization/deserialization.
Index structures (B-trees, LSM trees, etc.).
Crash recovery (journaling or write-ahead logging).
Key Components:
Page Manager: Handles reading/writing fixed-size pages to/from disk.
Log Manager: Maintains a write-ahead log or journal for durability.
Buffer Manager: Caches data in memory for faster access.

#### b. Query Processor

Handles parsing and executing queries from users.

Responsibilities:
Query parsing and validation.
Query optimization (e.g., choosing indexes, efficient joins).
Query execution (iterators, execution plans).
Key Components:
Query Parser: Converts user queries into an internal format (e.g., AST).
Query Planner: Generates an execution plan for optimal performance.
Query Executor: Executes the plan against the storage engine.

#### c. Index Manager

Manages indexing structures to speed up data retrieval.

Responsibilities:
Create, update, and delete indexes.
Efficient lookup and maintenance (e.g., during data updates).
Key Index Types:
B-tree or B+ tree.
Hash indexes.
Secondary indexes.

#### d. Transaction Manager

Ensures that operations on the database adhere to ACID principles.

Responsibilities:
Begin, commit, and rollback transactions.
Concurrency control (locks, MVCC).
Crash recovery and consistency checks.
Key Components:
Lock Manager: Ensures consistency during concurrent access.
Log Manager: Writes transaction logs for rollback/replay.

#### e. Networking Layer (optional for server-based databases)

Handles communication between the database server and clients.

Responsibilities:
Accept connections from clients.
Send and receive queries over the network.
Handle protocol-specific logic (e.g., HTTP for REST APIs, custom binary protocols).

### 2. Supporting Modules

#### a. Configuration Manager

Manages database settings.

Responsibilities:
Load configuration from files, environment variables, or defaults.
Provide runtime tunables (e.g., cache size, file paths).

#### b. Logging and Monitoring

Tracks database operations and performance metrics.

Responsibilities:
Write logs for debugging, auditing, and performance analysis.
Expose metrics (e.g., query latency, cache hits/misses).

#### c. Security Manager

Handles authentication, authorization, and encryption.

Responsibilities:
Manage user accounts and roles.
Enforce permissions for queries and data access.
Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

#### d. Schema Manager

Manages the database schema (tables, columns, constraints).

Responsibilities:
Define and validate schemas.
Handle schema migrations (add/drop columns, indexes).
Enforce constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).

### 3. Specialized Modules

#### a. Cache Manager

Speeds up data access by storing frequently accessed data in memory.

Responsibilities:
Manage in-memory caches (e.g., page cache, query results).
Use eviction policies like LRU (Least Recently Used).

#### b. Replication and Sharding (for distributed databases)

Replication:
Copy data across multiple nodes for redundancy.
Implement leader-follower or multi-leader replication.
Sharding:
Split data horizontally across multiple nodes for scalability.

#### c. Backup and Restore

Handles database snapshots and recovery.

Responsibilities:
Create backups of data and logs.
Restore the database to a specific state.

#### d. Analytics Module (Optional)

For analytical databases, a dedicated module for running complex aggregations and analytical queries.
